# presentink
Simple script to make pdf presentations with inkscape. Requires python3, pdftk and inkscape 1.0.

This script was forked from mkpdfs by Steven Bell (https://gist.github.com/stevenbell/909c79c9396f932942476e658b38d80c), which in turn was inspired by mkpdfs.rb (https://gist.github.com/emk/961877). Main addition done here is support for sublayers and preventing the script from rendering unchanged slides.

A full example is provided in presentation.svg, with the rendered result being presentation.pdf.
